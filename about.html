        <h1>The Origin Story</h1>
      </div>
      <h2>The Crash</h2>
      <p>
        On Feb 29, 2020, a leap year, Steve left DCJS meetup with his three tech
        acquaintances. After singing Queen Bohemian-Rhapsody, he merged onto the
        American Legion bridge and got in a rear-ended accident. Little did he
        know, this kicked off the start of a lonely global pandemic. During this
        time, he began hiking; he reflected on his work and life purpose for
        hours. After 83 hikes in 2020 and coming into 2021, he started to feel
        that familiar hunger for genuine connection.
      </p>
      <h2>The Epiphany</h2>
      <p>
        March 2020 - Aug 2021 were the most reflective moments in Steve’s life.
        His entire team got laid off, his dad caught cancer, and he hadn’t met
        anyone new in years. In September, in a sudden epiphany, he realized
        what had to be done. He had to bring back the tech community that built
        him from a college dropout to the software engineer he is today.
      </p>
      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        After closing on a house in the DC suburbs, he did the unthinkable. He
        decided to start New York Code and Coffee, a community for developers to
        grow and make friends… 5-hours away from home. Steve’s vision with NYC
        Code & Coffee is to create a
        <strong>
          community by software developers for software developers to grow and
          make friends.
        </strong>
